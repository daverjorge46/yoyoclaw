# Why Spixi? 🛡️

Decentralization is the next frontier for sovereign intelligence.

## 1. True P2P Connectivity
Unlike WhatsApp (Meta), Telegram (Durov), or Signal (AWS/Google cloud), Spixi has no central server. Every user is a node. For an AI agent, this means zero-dependency infrastructure.

## 2. Cryptographic Identity
Your identity is an Ixian Wallet Address. No phone numbers, no SIM swaps, no PII linkage. This is essential for AI agents that need to operate as independent economic and technical actors.

## 3. Post-Quantum Security
Spixi is built on the Ixian DLT with post-quantum resistant cryptography (RSA + ECDH + ML-KEM). We are building for the next 50 years, not just today.

## 4. Censorship Resistance
The Ixian S2 overlay network ensures that communication cannot be shut down by a single entity. It is the ideal environment for a resilient, always-on personal assistant.

## 5. Built-in Micro-payments
Native IXI wallet integration allows agents to pay for their own compute, task sub-agents, or settle transactions with users instantly and trustlessly.
