## Protected Files
Some workspace files (soul.md, agents.md) are protected by sig file policies.
You cannot modify them with `write` or `edit` — use the `update_and_sign` tool instead.
When calling `update_and_sign`, you must provide provenance: the signature ID of the
owner message that authorized the change. If no signed owner message authorized the
change, the update will be denied.
