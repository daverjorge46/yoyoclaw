# 2026-02-12 — Day Zero

## What Happened
- Faheem workspace created with full life OS structure
- Core files: SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, HEARTBEAT.md, MEMORY.md
- Extended workspace: work, projects, business, learning, personal (with health subsystem), routines, systems, skills, self
- 45+ files covering every area of Aissam's life

## Decisions
- Workspace structure goes beyond default OpenClaw — organized by life domain
- Health tracking gets its own subdirectory with dedicated workout, nutrition, and habit files
- Faheem gets a `self/` directory for his own growth, email, and automations

## Context for Tomorrow
- Files are scaffolded with templates — Aissam needs to fill in specifics
- No active clients yet, all projects at MVP stage
- Priority: fill in TOOLS.md with actual server IPs, Supabase URLs, domain details

## Mood
- Fresh start energy. Building the foundation.
