# Evening Routine

> Wind down properly. Good sleep = productive tomorrow.

## Target Start Time: _[1 hour before bed]_

## The Routine
| Order | Action | Duration | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Stop all work | — | Hard cutoff. No "just one more thing." |
| 2 | Quick daily review | 5 min | What got done? What carries to tomorrow? |
| 3 | Update daily memory file | 5 min | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — log key events |
| 4 | Check habits tracker | 2 min | Fill in `health/habits.md` for today |
| 5 | Prep tomorrow's tasks | 5 min | Top 3 priorities for tomorrow |
| 6 | Screen dimming / night mode | — | Reduce blue light |
| 7 | _[Prayer / Isha]_ | _[min]_ | _[if applicable]_ |
| 8 | Relaxation | 30 min | Reading, music, light gaming — no work |
| 9 | Lights out | — | Target bedtime |

## Non-negotiables
- No work after cutoff time
- Log something in the daily memory file
- Know tomorrow's top priority before sleeping

## Faheem's Evening Check
If configured via heartbeat, Faheem can ask:
- "Kho, did you log today? Anything important to save?"
- "What's the #1 thing for tomorrow?"

## Notes
- The evening routine is where consistency is built or broken
- If you skip the daily log, context is lost for the next session
