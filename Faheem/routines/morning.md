# Morning Routine

> The first hour sets the tone. Keep it simple, keep it consistent.

## Target Wake Time: _[time]_

## The Routine
| Order | Action | Duration | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Wake up — no snooze | — | Put phone across the room if needed |
| 2 | _[Prayer / Fajr]_ | _[min]_ | _[if applicable]_ |
| 3 | Drink a full glass of water | 1 min | Hydrate before anything else |
| 4 | Wash face, brush teeth | 5 min | Wake your body up |
| 5 | Quick stretch / mobility | 5-10 min | See `health/workout-plan.md` warm-up section |
| 6 | Breakfast | 15 min | Keep it simple — see `health/nutrition.md` |
| 7 | Review today's plan | 5 min | Check calendar, tasks, priorities |
| 8 | Start deep work or Hostinger shift | — | Depending on schedule |

## Total time: ~30-40 minutes

## Non-negotiables
- Water before coffee/tea
- No social media in first 30 minutes
- Know your top 3 priorities before starting work

## Variations
### Hostinger Shift Day
- Wake → routine → start shift on time
- No side project work in the morning

### Free Day (No Shift)
- Wake → routine → 1-2 hours of deep project work before anything else
- This is your most productive window — protect it

## Notes
- If you wake up late, do the shortened version: water, face, priorities, go
- Faheem can send a morning brief if configured
