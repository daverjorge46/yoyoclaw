# Workday Structure

> Balance Hostinger (stability) with side projects (growth). Never let them bleed into each other.

## Hostinger Day Template
| Time Block | Activity | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| _[shift start]_ | Morning routine → Hostinger shift | 100% focus on Hostinger |
| _[shift end]_ | Break / transition | Decompress. Walk. Eat. |
| _[+30min]_ | Side project: deep work block | 1-2 hours of focused project work |
| _[+2hr]_ | Free time / learning | Flexible: study, explore, relax |
| _[evening]_ | Evening routine | Wind down, daily log |

## Time Blocks

### Deep Work Rules
- Phone on DND
- No social media tabs open
- One task at a time — no project-hopping
- Timer: 25-50 min work, 5-10 min break (Pomodoro optional)

### Side Project Allocation
| Day | After Shift | Project Focus |
|-----|------------|---------------|
| Mon | 1-2 hrs | _[project or task]_ |
| Tue | 1-2 hrs | _[project or task]_ |
| Wed | 1-2 hrs | _[project or task]_ |
| Thu | 1-2 hrs | _[project or task]_ |
| Fri | _[varies]_ | _[lighter or rest]_ |

### Priority Order (When Time is Limited)
1. Hostinger shift (non-negotiable)
2. Highest-priority active project
3. Agency client work (if any)
4. Learning
5. Everything else

## Energy Management
- **High energy:** Deep coding, complex problem-solving, writing proposals
- **Medium energy:** Research, learning, content creation
- **Low energy:** Admin, organizing, emails, bookmarks

Match the task to your energy level, not the other way around.

## Distractions
- If a new idea pops up → dump it in `business/ideas.md` and go back to work
- If a non-urgent message comes in → reply in the next break
- If something breaks → assess if it's truly urgent or can wait

## Notes
- Track actual hours spent on side projects weekly
- Faheem should protect Hostinger time — push back if projects creep in
