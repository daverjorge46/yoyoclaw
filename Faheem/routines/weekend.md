# Weekend Routine

> Weekends are for bigger project blocks, rest, and life. Balance is the goal.

## Saturday
| Time Block | Activity | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Morning | Morning routine | Same as weekday |
| _[2-3 hrs]_ | Deep project work | Biggest block of the week — use it well |
| Afternoon | Flexible | Social, errands, hobbies, rest |
| Evening | Light work or learning | Or just relax |

## Sunday (or Friday if applicable)
| Time Block | Activity | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Morning | Slower start | Sleep in if needed |
| _[1-2 hrs]_ | Weekly review | See `routines/weekly-review.md` |
| _[1-2 hrs]_ | Meal prep | See `health/meal-plan.md` |
| Afternoon | Personal time | Hobbies, social, rest |
| Evening | Prep for the week | Plan Monday, check calendar |

## Weekend Priorities
1. Weekly review (non-negotiable)
2. One big project push (the thing you couldn't finish during the week)
3. Health (workout, meal prep, outdoor time)
4. Rest and hobbies (guilt-free)

## What NOT To Do on Weekends
- Don't work all day both days — burnout is real
- Don't skip the weekly review
- Don't fill the whole weekend with "productive" tasks — recharging IS productive

## Notes
- Weekends are where projects actually move forward
- Protect at least one 3-hour deep work block
- But also protect genuine rest time
