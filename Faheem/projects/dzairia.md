## Overview

- **Status:** Previously built, evaluating next steps
- **Domain:** dzairia.com

## The Problem
Algerian e-commerce sellers (mostly on Facebook/Instagram) need COD-ready landing pages but don't have the technical skills to build them. International tools like Shopify don't support COD natively and are priced in USD (too expensive for the market).

## The Solution
A drag-and-drop sales page builder designed specifically for Algerian e-commerce. Built-in COD order forms, Arabic RTL support, DZD pricing, wilaya-based delivery zones.

## Target Market
- **Who:** Facebook/Instagram sellers, COD e-commerce operators
- **Where:** Algeria
- **Size:** Thousands of active sellers in Facebook groups

## Notes
- Overlaps with nbi3.cash — need to decide if these are the same product or different
- The Algerian COD e-commerce market is huge but messy
- Delivery confirmation and tracking are the biggest pain points
