## Overview
- **One-liner:** Football match organizing platform with skill assessment for Algeria
- **Status:** MVP — specs in progress
- **Domain:** _[to be filled]_
- **Repo:** _[GitHub URL to be filled]_

## The Problem
Organizing football matches in Algeria is chaotic. Finding players, balancing teams, booking fields — it's all done through scattered WhatsApp groups. No structured way to find games, rate players, or track your own progress.

## Target Market
