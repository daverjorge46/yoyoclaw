# nbi3.cash — نبيع

## Overview
- **One-liner:** COD landing page builder for Algerian sellers
- **Status:** _[to be filled — idea? MVP? live?]_
- **Domain:** nbi3.cash
- **Repo:** _[GitHub URL to be filled]_

## The Problem
Same space as Dzairia — Algerian Facebook/Instagram sellers need quick, conversion-optimized landing pages with COD order forms. They don't want to learn Shopify or code. They just want: product photo, price, order form, done.

## The Solution
Dead-simple landing page generator. Pick a template, add your product, set the price in DZD, choose delivery wilayas, publish. Customer fills the form, order goes to WhatsApp/dashboard.

## Relationship to Dzairia
- _[Are these the same product with different branding?]_
- _[Is nbi3 the simpler version? Dzairia the full platform?]_
- _[Decision needed: merge, differentiate, or kill one]_

## Target Market
- **Who:** Small-scale COD sellers, especially on Facebook
- **Where:** Algeria
- **Price sensitivity:** Very high — must be cheap or freemium

## Competitors
| Name | What they do | Weakness we exploit |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| Youcan | Moroccan e-commerce builder | Not simple enough, not Algeria-native |
| Systeme.io | Funnel builder | No COD, no Arabic, too complex |

## Notes
- "nbi3" (نبيع) means "we sell" — great branding for the Algerian market
- Landing page → WhatsApp order flow is the sweet spot
- Keep it stupid simple. The target user can barely use Facebook Business Suite.
