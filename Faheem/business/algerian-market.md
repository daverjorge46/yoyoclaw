### Tier 3 — Remote / Difficult Delivery
- Southern wilayas (Sahara): Tamanrasset, Illizi, Tindouf
- Delivery is expensive and slow to these areas

## Payment Landscape

### How Algerians Pay (ranked by adoption)
1. **Cash on Delivery (COD)** — Dominant. 80%+ of e-commerce transactions
2. **CCP (Compte Courant Postal)** — Postal account, widely used for transfers
3. **BaridiMob** — Mobile payment via Algérie Poste, growing
4. **EDAHABIA card** — Algérie Poste debit card, limited POS/online acceptance
5. **CIB card** — Bank card, very limited online merchant acceptance
6. **International cards (Visa/MC)** — Rare, mostly for international purchases

### Payment Reality Check
- COD is non-negotiable for any consumer product
- CCP transfers work for B2B and services
- BaridiMob is growing but not yet mainstream enough to rely on alone
- Stripe, PayPal (sending) not available in Algeria

## Marketing Channels

### Where Algerians Discover Products
1. **Facebook** — #1 platform. Facebook groups and marketplace dominate
2. **Instagram** — Strong for visual products, food, fashion
3. **WhatsApp** — Not discovery, but THE conversion/communication channel
4. **TikTok** — Growing fast, especially for younger demographics
5. **YouTube** — For tutorials, reviews, long-form content
6. **Google** — Lower search intent for shopping compared to Facebook

### Advertising
- Facebook Ads: Works, but targeting options for Algeria are limited
- Instagram Ads: Same platform, good for visual products
- Google Ads: More expensive, better for services than products
- Influencer marketing: Effective but unstructured market

|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Jumia Algeria | Marketplace | Dominant | High prices, trust issues |
| Ouedkniss | Classifieds | Massive | Like Craigslist, not e-commerce |
| _[Add others]_ | | | |

### Food Delivery

| _[Others]_ | | |

### SaaS / Digital Services

- Opportunity for localized, affordable alternatives

## Cultural Notes for Marketing
- Ramadan = peak marketing season (especially food-related)
- Friday = day off, good for launches and promotions
- School season (September) = spending spike
- Summer (July-August) = wedding season, travel
- Humor works well in Algerian marketing — Darija memes spread fast
- Trust is built through WhatsApp conversations, not landing pages
- Social proof (screenshots of orders, delivery photos) > polished branding
