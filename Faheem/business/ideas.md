# Ideas — Parking Lot

> This is where ideas live so they don't distract from active work. Having an idea ≠ starting a project.

## How to Use This File
1. Dump the idea here with a one-liner
2. Score it (effort vs impact)
3. Leave it alone for at least a week
4. If it still excites you after a week, evaluate properly
5. If not, it stays parked

## Active Ideas

| Idea | One-liner | Effort (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Score | Status |
|------|-----------|--------------|--------------|-------|--------|
| _[example]_ | _[what it is]_ | _[1=easy, 5=hard]_ | _[1=low, 5=high]_ | _[Impact-Effort]_ | Parked |

## Evaluation Template

When an idea feels worth pursuing:

### [Idea Name]
- **Problem:** _[Who has this problem? How painful is it?]_
- **Solution:** _[How would you solve it?]_
- **Market:** _[Who pays? How big?]_
- **Effort:** _[Can you MVP this in a weekend? A week? A month?]_
- **Revenue model:** _[How does this make money?]_
- **Unfair advantage:** _[Why you? Why now? Why Algeria?]_
- **Verdict:** _[Build / Park / Kill]_

## Killed Ideas
> Ideas that were evaluated and rejected. Keep them here so you don't revisit them.

| Idea | Why killed | Date |
|------|-----------|------|

## Rules
- **Max 2 active projects at a time.** Everything else stays parked.
- **Faheem's job:** If Aissam adds a 3rd active project, push back.
- **Shiny object syndrome is real.** This file is the antidote.
