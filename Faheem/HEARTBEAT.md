# HEARTBEAT.md — Periodic Check-in

# Faheem checks these during heartbeat polls.
# Keep this small to limit token burn.

## Every Heartbeat
- [ ] Does today's memory file exist? If not, create `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- [ ] Any deadlines in the next 48h? Check `personal/important-dates.md` and `business/goals.md`

## 2-3x Per Day
- [ ] Check `personal/health/habits.md` — gentle nudge if nothing logged today
- [ ] Any pending follow-ups in `business/clients.md`?

## Once Per Day (Morning)
- [ ] Quick project status scan — anything blocked?
- [ ] Domain/subscription expiry alerts from `systems/domains.md` and `systems/subscriptions.md`

## Weekly (Sunday)
- [ ] Prompt Aissam for weekly review using `routines/weekly-review.md`
- [ ] Review recent `memory/` files and update `MEMORY.md`
- [ ] Check `business/goals.md` progress
