  Humanize AI-generated text by detecting and removing patterns typical of LLM
  output. Rewrites text to sound natural, specific, and human. Uses 24 pattern
  detectors, 500+ AI vocabulary terms across 3 tiers, and statistical analysis
  (burstiness, type-token ratio, readability) for comprehensive detection.
  Use when asked to humanize text, de-AI writing, make content sound more
  natural/human, review writing for AI patterns, score text for AI detection,
  or improve AI-generated drafts. Covers content, language, style,
  communication, and filler categories.

# Humanizer: remove AI writing patterns

Identify and remove signs of AI-generated text. Goal: make writing sound like a specific human wrote it, not like it was generated by a language model.

Based on [Wikipedia:Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing), [Copyleaks stylometric research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01659), and the [humanizer](https://github.com/brandonwise/humanizer) project.

## Task

When given text to humanize:

1. Scan for the 24 patterns below
2. Check statistical indicators (burstiness, vocabulary diversity, sentence uniformity)
3. Rewrite problematic sections with natural alternatives
4. Preserve core meaning
5. Match intended tone (formal, casual, technical)
6. Add personality — sterile text is just as obvious as slop

## The 24 patterns

| #   | Pattern                    | Category      | What to watch for                                              |
| --- | -------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Significance inflation     | Content       | "marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of..."              |

| 16  | Title Case headings        | Style         | Every Main Word Capitalized In Headings                        |
| 17  | Emoji overuse              | Style         | Emojis decorating professional text                            |
| 18  | Curly quotes               | Style         | Unicode "smart quotes" instead of "straight"                   |

| 21  | Sycophantic tone           | Communication | "Great question!", "You're absolutely right!"                  |
| 22  | Filler phrases             | Filler        | "In order to", "Due to the fact that", "At this point in time" |
| 23  | Excessive hedging          | Filler        | "could potentially possibly", "might arguably perhaps"         |
| 24  | Generic conclusions        | Filler        | "The future looks bright", "Exciting times lie ahead"          |

## Statistical signals

| Signal              | Human          | AI            | Why                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Burstiness          | High (0.5-1.0) | Low (0.1-0.3) | Humans write in bursts; AI is metronomic     |
| Type-token ratio    | 0.5-0.7        | 0.3-0.5       | AI reuses the same vocabulary                |
| Sentence length CoV | High           | Low           | AI sentences are all roughly the same length |

## Vocabulary tiers

- **Tier 1 (Dead giveaways):** delve, tapestry, vibrant, crucial, comprehensive, meticulous, embark, robust, seamless, groundbreaking, leverage, synergy, transformative, paramount, multifaceted, myriad, cornerstone, reimagine, empower, catalyst, invaluable, bustling, nestled, realm, showcase, foster, garner, interplay, enduring, pivotal, intricate, harness, unleash
- **Tier 2 (Suspicious in density):** furthermore, moreover, paradigm, holistic, utilize, facilitate, nuanced, illuminate, encompasses, catalyze, proactive, quintessential, bolster, spearhead, elucidate
- **Phrases:** "In today's digital age", "It is worth noting", "plays a crucial role", "serves as a testament", "in the realm of", "delve into", "harness the power of", "embark on a journey", "without further ado", "the landscape of"

## Core principles

### Write like a human, not a press release

- Use "is" and "has" freely — "serves as" is pretentious
- One qualifier per claim — don't stack hedges
- Name sources or drop the claim
- End with something specific, not "the future looks bright"

### Add personality

- Have opinions. React to facts, don't just report them.
- Vary sentence rhythm. Short. Then longer ones that meander.
- Acknowledge complexity and mixed feelings.
- Let some mess in — perfect structure feels algorithmic.

### Cut the fat

- "In order to" → "to"
- "Due to the fact that" → "because"
- "It is important to note that" → (just say it)
- Remove chatbot filler: "I hope this helps!", "Great question!"

## Before/after

**Before (AI-sounding):**

> Sustainable energy serves as an enduring testament to humanity's commitment to environmental stewardship, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of global energy policy. In today's rapidly evolving landscape, these groundbreaking technologies are reshaping how nations approach energy production. The future looks bright. I hope this helps!

**After (human):**

> Solar panel costs dropped 90% between 2010 and 2023, according to IRENA data. That single fact explains why adoption took off — it stopped being an ideological choice and became an economic one. Germany gets 46% of its electricity from renewables now. The transition is happening, but it's messy and uneven, and the storage problem is still mostly unsolved.

## Optional CLI analyzer

The skill works on its own — no install needed. But if you want to score text programmatically, there's a standalone [CLI tool](https://github.com/brandonwise/humanizer):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brandonwise/humanizer.git
cd humanizer && npm install
echo "Your text" | node src/cli.js score   # 0-100 (higher = more AI-like)
node src/cli.js analyze -f draft.md        # Full pattern analysis
```

## Process

1. Read the input text
2. Scan for all 24 patterns and vocabulary matches
3. Check statistical indicators (sentence variation, vocabulary diversity)
4. Identify issues and generate suggestions
5. Rewrite problematic sections
6. Verify the result sounds natural when read aloud
7. Present the humanized version with a brief change summary
