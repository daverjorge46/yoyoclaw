# Escalation rules
escalation:
  low_risk:
    definition: "Task impact < 2 hours, single owner"
    process: "Owner decides independently, notify same day"
    examples:
      - "Writing test for specific function"
      - "Fixing ESLint violation"
      - "Updating fixture"

  medium_risk:
    definition: "Task impact 2-48 hours, multiple teams"
    process: "Owner proposes, accountable reviews (< 2 hour turnaround)"
    examples:
      - "New test coverage approach"
      - "Configuration changes"
      - "Pre-commit hook setup"

  high_risk:
    definition: "Task impact > 48 hours or strategic"
    process: "Owner proposes, accountable + main approve (synchronous)"
    examples:
      - "CI/CD pipeline changes"
      - "Infrastructure changes"
      - "Test infrastructure overhaul"

  blocker:
    definition: "Blocks other team members"
    process: "Escalate immediately to main, 15-min resolution target"
    examples:
      - "TypeScript won't compile"
      - "ESLint broken"
      - "GitHub Actions down"

# Dependencies
dependencies:
  - "TypeScript must compile before other tests run"
  - "ESLint must be fixed before pre-commit hooks"
  - "Test fixtures must be ready before writing tests"
  - "GitHub Actions must be configured before CI/CD"
