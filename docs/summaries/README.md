# Summaries

This directory contains fix documentation, reliability reports, and implementation summaries.

## Organization

Files are named with the pattern: `{system}-fix-summary-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

- **system**: What system was fixed (telegram, reliability, etc.)
- **date**: When the fixes were implemented

## Existing Summaries

- **reliability-fixes-2025-12-31.md** - Summary of various reliability improvements
- **telegram-reliability-fix-2025-12-31.md** - Telegram bot reliability fixes and improvements

## When to Add New Summaries

Create a new summary when:
- Documenting completed fix implementations
- Summarizing reliability improvements
- Recording production incident resolutions
- Creating post-mortem reports with action items

These documents are typically written **after** fixes are implemented and serve as reference for future maintenance.
