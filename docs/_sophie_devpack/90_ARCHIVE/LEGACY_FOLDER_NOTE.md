# Legacy Folder Reference Note
**Generated:** 2026-02-05
**Purpose:** Document location and policy for legacy AgentSophie materials

---

## Legacy Folder Location

**Path:** `~/Documents/_legacy_agentsophie/`

**Status:** READ-ONLY historical reference

---

## Contents

The legacy folder contains copied artifacts from a prior Clawdbot/Sophie installation that was uninstalled. These materials are preserved for reference only.

**Subdirectories observed:**
- SIOE_CORE/
- clawd/
- clawd-dev/
- clawd-legacy-backup/
- clawd-main/
- go/

---

## Policy (Binding)

Per bootstrap instructions:

1. **READ-ONLY:** Treat `_legacy_agentsophie` as historical reference only
2. **NO REFACTORING:** Do not move, delete, or modify anything inside it
3. **NOT AUTHORITATIVE:** Do not treat as authoritative source code
4. **SELECTIVE COPYING:** May selectively copy governance-relevant markdown files into `docs/_sophie_devpack/90_ARCHIVE/` with notes
5. **ACTIVE SYSTEM:** The authoritative, active system is ONLY: `~/Documents/clawdbot`

---

## Bootstrap Decision

During 2026-02-05 bootstrap:
- Legacy folder was discovered and noted
- No files were copied from legacy (governance docs came from external uploads)
- Legacy remains untouched per instructions
- Future sessions may reference it if needed

---

## If You Need Legacy Materials

1. Navigate to `~/Documents/_legacy_agentsophie/`
2. Read relevant files directly
3. If incorporating content, copy to `90_ARCHIVE/` with clear notes
4. Never modify legacy folder contents
