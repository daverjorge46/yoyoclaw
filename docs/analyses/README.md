# Technical Analyses

This directory contains in-depth technical analyses of architecture, design decisions, and system evaluations.

## Organization

Files are named with the pattern: `{topic}-{focus}-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

- **topic**: What was analyzed (dockerization, performance, security, etc.)
- **focus**: Specific aspect (stability, scalability, maintainability, etc.)
- **date**: When the analysis was completed

## Existing Analyses

- **dockerization-stability-2025-12-31.md** - Analysis of Dockerization feasibility and stability risks for the gateway

## When to Add New Analyses

Create a new analysis when:
- Evaluating architectural changes
- Assessing technical debt
- Analyzing system stability or performance
- Making major technology decisions
- Planning migrations or refactors

These are typically more forward-looking than investigations and may include recommendations.
