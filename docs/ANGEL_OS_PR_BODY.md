**AI-assisted PR.** Angel OS is OpenClaw + adoption of the Angel OS Constitution. This PR adds minimal docs so contributors and forks see how Angel OS relates to OpenClaw and the strategy (Constitution-first, minimal changes). Longer-term goal: an immutable seed prompt, open for discussion and refinement.

- **What:** New docs: ANGEL_OS_ALIGNMENT.md, ANGEL_OS_CONSTITUTION_SEED.md, plus one README sentence with link.
- **Why:** Raise awareness and open discussion; no runtime or config changes.
- **Testing:** Docs only. Lightly tested: docs reviewed for accuracy.
- **Understanding:** The added docs describe Angel OS alignment and a minimal Constitution seed; no code or behavior change.
