## The 5 Sleep Diary Questions (Track Daily)

1. What time did you get in bed?
2. What time did you try to fall asleep (lights out)?
3. How long did it take to fall asleep?
4. How many times did you wake up? For how long?
5. What time did you wake up for good? Get out of bed?

**Calculate**: Sleep Efficiency = (Sleep Time / Time In Bed) × 100

## Stimulus Control (The 6 Rules)

1. **Sleepy, not tired** — Lie down only when eyes-heavy sleepy
2. **Bed = sleep + sex only** — No reading, TV, phones, worrying
3. **20-minute rule** — Not asleep? Get up.
4. **Leave the room** — Dim light, boring activity
5. **Return when sleepy** — Repeat as needed
6. **Fixed wake time** — Same time every day, no snooze
7. **No naps** — Save sleep drive for night

## Sleep Restriction Quick Math

**Starting PTIB (Prescribed Time In Bed)**:
- Average sleep time from baseline week
- Minimum = 5 hours (safety floor)
- Fixed wake time - PTIB = Bedtime

**Weekly Adjustment**:
| Sleep Efficiency | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| < 85% | Cut 15 min from PTIB |
| 85-90% | Keep same |
| > 90% + rested | Add 15 min to PTIB |

## Common Dysfunctional Thoughts

| Thought | Reframe |
|---------|---------|
| "I need 8 hours" | "Sleep need varies; 6-7 hours is fine for many" |
| "Tomorrow will be ruined" | "One bad night = tough but manageable" |
| "I must try harder" | "Trying creates arousal; sleep is passive" |
| "Insomnia is killing me" | "Worry is worse than occasional bad sleep" |
| "I haven't slept in days" | "Perception is often distorted; microsleeps happen" |

## One-Liner Interventions

**For resistance to getting out of bed:**
> "The 20-minute rule protects your bed-sleep connection. Temporary discomfort, permanent gain."

**For worry about tomorrow:**
> "What's the evidence that one bad night ruins your day? You've survived them before."

**For daytime sleepiness during restriction:**
> "Sleepiness means it's working. Your sleep drive is building."

**For weekend schedule slip:**
> "Monday's sleep starts Sunday morning. Keep the wake time."

**For "I tried everything":**
> "Have you tried CBT-I consistently for 6-8 weeks? It's the gold standard for a reason."

## Integration with EF Coaching

| Sleep Issue | EF Impact | Response |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Poor sleep last night | Poor focus today | Lower expectations, use body doubling |
| Rumination at bedtime | Can't start tomorrow's tasks | Brain dump before bed |
| Sleep restriction adherence | Hard to wake up | External accountability for wake time |
| "Too tired to start" | Task avoidance | Check: sleep debt or avoidance? |
