# Cursor Resolutions Log

> Recent resolutions from Cursor sessions. Liam should check this file during heartbeats to acknowledge completed fixes.

**Purpose:** Bidirectional communication between Cursor and Liam. When Cursor resolves Evolution Queue items, they are logged here so Liam knows what was fixed without re-reading the entire queue.

**Protocol:**
1. Cursor adds entries when resolving Evolution Queue items
2. Liam reads during heartbeats (every 30 min)
3. Liam acknowledges by checking the item (optional: add ack timestamp)
4. Entries older than 7 days can be pruned
